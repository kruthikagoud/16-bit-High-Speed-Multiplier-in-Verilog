# ⚡ 16-bit High-Speed Multiplier in Verilog

This repository contains the complete implementation of a **16-bit High-Speed Multiplier** designed in Verilog HDL, simulated, synthesized, and physically implemented using a full ASIC design flow.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Multipliers are essential components in digital systems, widely used in processors, DSPs, and cryptographic circuits.  
In this project, we designed a **16-bit multiplier** using Verilog, verified through simulation, synthesized into standard cells, and implemented using physical design tools.

## 🚀 Key Features
✅ RTL design of 16-bit multiplier in Verilog  
✅ Simulation using Cadence NCLaunch (testbench included)  
✅ Synthesis using Cadence Genus with `.tcl` and `.sdc` constraints  
✅ Physical Design (Place & Route) using Cadence Innovus  
✅ Area utilization and reports before & after filler cell insertion  
✅ Final layout and analysis reports generated
